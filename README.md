# Portfolio B — Workspace

An alternative personal portfolio for **Ezequel Bautista**, built as a compact
developer workspace rather than a long scrolling page.

The whole portfolio — who I am, what I've built, my stack, my experience and how
to reach me — fits in a single viewport from 1280px up. Navigation opens drawers
over the board instead of loading pages, so nothing costs a page load.

This is a standalone version of the experiment that first lived at `/v2` in
[ezykel225/Portfolio2](https://github.com/ezykel225/Portfolio2). The original
portfolio is a separate project.

## Stack

Next.js 15 (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript (strict) · Tailwind CSS v4 ·
next/font. No backend, no database, no runtime dependencies beyond the framework.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:3000
```

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run build       # production build
npm run lint        # eslint
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
```

## Where the content lives

`lib/data.ts` is the single source of truth for every piece of content — personal
details, projects and their case studies, experience, education, tech stack and
links. Edit that file and the whole site follows; no component holds copy of its
own.

Durations and year counts are **never** typed by hand. They are derived from the
`start` / `end` months in `lib/data.ts` through the helpers in `lib/utils.ts`, so
the timeline, the headline figures and the prose cannot contradict each other.

`lib/workspace.ts` is a view-model over that data: it groups, orders and formats,
but never introduces a fact of its own.

## Layout

Three deliberate compositions rather than one design scaled down:

| Width | Composition |
| --- | --- |
| `< 1024px` | Stacked column, identity card on top, navigation in a thumb-reachable bottom bar |
| `1024–1279px` | Persistent left rail, two columns, compact cards in a strip |
| `≥ 1280px` | Left rail, main column, third column of cards — the board stops scrolling |
| `≥ 1440px` | Third column widens |

The no-scroll board is gated on viewport height as well as width, so a short
desktop window scrolls rather than crushing the project tiles.

## Colours

All design tokens are declared once in `app/globals.css` under `@theme`.
`app/workspace.css` only aliases them — it introduces no hex values of its own.

## Accessibility

- Every rendered text node meets WCAG AA against its composited background
- Drawers are native `<dialog>` + `showModal()`, so focus trapping, Esc-to-close
  and page inertness come from the platform
- Skip link, visible focus rings on every control, one `<h1>`, one `<main>`
- `prefers-reduced-motion` removes every animation on the page
