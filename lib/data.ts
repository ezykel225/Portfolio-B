  bio: [
    "I'm Ezequel, a 4th year BSIT student at Asian College of Science and Technology (graduating 2027), based in Dumaguete, Central Visayas, Philippines.",
    "I learn by building things that have to actually work. My two main projects are a barangay e-processing system — React and Supabase, with role-based dashboards, Row Level Security policies and a booking system — and a React Native fitness app built with Expo. Both are live, and both repositories are public.",
    "Alongside my studies I've built hands-on IT experience through two internships, as an IT Support Intern at ECE Contact Centers and Inspiro/Infocom. I've also worked remotely as a Data Annotator with Remotasks PH and Outlier AI on AI training projects, and in customer service at Qualfon Dumaguete — work that taught me to be careful, self-managed, and clear with people.",
